Plasmids and the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes they carry can be the infectious agents in hospitals as opposed to a specific clonal lineage. Epidemiologically-linked *Enterobacterales* isolates carrying carbapenemases on mobilizable plasmids challenge infection prevention and control (IPAC) practices due to the limit of plasmid detection through conventional epidemiological investigations. Long-read sequencing is crucial for the detailed tracking of plasmid transmission dynamics. In this study, we investigated 34 *bla*NDM producers isolated over 9 months from a single hospital site. We sequenced all isolates with Illumina and 26 with Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms. We used molecular typing in combination with single nucleotide variant analysis to determine clonal transmission events ([SNVPhyl](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000116)) and clustering analysis ([MOB-suite](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.000206)) to determine plasmid transmission events. We found 8 different plasmid types across 6 species. A combination of clonal and plasmid transmission was observed for acquisition and dissemination of NDM-1, NDM-5, and NDM-7. An IncX3 plasmid encoding NDM-7 was found in 5 species and 8 sequence types. Three epidemiologically-linked groups of patients were identified and supported by the transmission results, demonstrating the importance of reporting plasmid transmission to hospital sites. Our report helped target infection control efforts to relevant instances of transmission and enabled clinicians to better assess the threats posed by emerging antibiotic-resistant organisms.
